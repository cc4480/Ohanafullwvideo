- Efficient caching strategies for static assets
- Optimized image loading and processing
- Code splitting and lazy loading for faster initial page loads

### 5. Progressive Web App (PWA) Capabilities

- Service worker implementation for offline functionality
- Web app manifest for native app-like experience
- Offline fallback page for improved user experience
- Cache management for core application assets

### 6. Deployment Scripts

- Automated build and deployment process
- Database migration scripts for safe schema updates
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Production logging and monitoring setup

## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+ and npm v8+
- PostgreSQL database
- Environment variables (see `.env.example` for required variables)

### Step 1: Environment Setup

Before deploying, make sure you have the following environment variables set:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database
NODE_ENV=production
```

These can be set in your hosting platform's environment configuration.

### Step 2: Database Deployment

Run the database deployment script to set up the database schema and initial data:

```bash
./deploy-db.sh
```

This script will:
1. Push all schema changes to the database
2. Check if initialization is needed
3. Seed initial data if the database is empty

### Step 3: Application Deployment

Run the main deployment script to build and deploy the application:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This script will:
1. Build the frontend application for production
2. Build the backend server for production
3. Generate the sitemap for SEO
4. Copy all necessary static files
5. Start the application in production mode

### Step 4: Verification

After deployment, verify the following:

1. Application is accessible at the expected URL
2. Database connections are working properly
3. Video streaming functionality works on different devices
4. SEO features are in place (check sitemap.xml and robots.txt)

## Video Streaming Configuration

The application uses adaptive video streaming with three quality levels:

1. **Mobile Optimized**: Smaller chunk sizes (2MB) and lower resolution for mobile devices
2. **Standard**: Medium quality for most desktop users
3. **High Performance**: Maximum quality for users with fast connections

These are served through the following endpoints:
- `/api/video/ohana/mobile`: Mobile-optimized version
- `/api/video/ohana`: Standard version
- `/api/video/ohana/highperf`: High-performance version

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Updates

For regular application updates:

1. Pull the latest code changes
2. Run `./deploy.sh` to rebuild and restart the application

### Database Schema Updates

For database schema updates:

1. Update the schema definitions in `shared/schema.ts`
2. Run `./deploy-db.sh` to apply the changes

### Sitemap Regeneration

To regenerate the sitemap after content updates:

```bash
bash scripts/generate-sitemap.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
   - Check network connectivity to database server
   - Ensure database user has proper permissions

2. **Video Streaming Issues**
   - Check video file permissions and availability
   - Verify media storage paths are correct
   - Monitor server resources during streaming

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Check server resource utilization
   - Verify caching headers are properly set
   - Review database query performance

### Logging

In production, logs are structured and include request information and performance metrics. Check server logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate issues with the application.
